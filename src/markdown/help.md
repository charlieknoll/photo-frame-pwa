## About PhotoAh

Photoah is a simple slideshow app which allows you to display a slideshow from a Google Photos album. It has the following features:

- True fullscreen mode when installed as PWA using Google Chrome
- Keeps the screen on, overriding the devices screen lock timeout
- Shows a notification icon when new photos have been added to the album. This works especially well with shared albums.
- You can control the time each photo is shown

## Getting Started

Contact the developer for an api key and then navigate to https://photoah.com?apikey=API_KEY, replacing "API_KEY" with the api key.

Use Google Chrome and enter the album title that you would like to show in the [Settings](https://photoah.com/settings) page.  You can find your albums in the "Albums" section of [Google Photos](https://photos.google.com).

Navigate to the [Slideshow](https://photoah.com/slideshow) page and watch your photos scroll by.  Leave your tablet or phone in a desirable place in your home and it behaves as a digital picture frame.

Click "Yes" when prompted to install Photoah app (this will allow true fullscreen mode)
