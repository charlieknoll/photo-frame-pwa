### Things learned

- Windows has an animations setting that can be turned on and off and that stops browser animations. animate.style has more info
- Quasar is very much a wrapper around Vue, if info can't be found in quasar docs, go to the Vue docs
- Getting debugging working is hard, see the launch.json for config
- Don't add scripts to the dom in boot files, it causes problems with PWA detection
- Workbox is the new way to manage service workers
- To pick a "natural" color, copy a screen shot and paste into Paint.net and use the color picker
